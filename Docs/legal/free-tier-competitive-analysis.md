## Competitive Assessment: ⚖️ **WELL-BALANCED**

Our free tier is **competitive but not overly generous**:

### Strengths:
- More sophisticated analysis than most free tiers
- Better format-specific recommendations
- Comprehensive synergy detection
- Professional power level analysis

### Not Too Much:
- No AI-powered insights (perfect premium differentiator)
- No advanced meta analysis or win rate predictions
- No detailed card replacement suggestions
- No tournament-level optimization

### Not Too Little:
- Provides genuine value for casual players
- Shows enough sophistication to justify premium upgrade
- Includes features that competitors charge for

## Trial Strategy Recommendations

### **7-Day Trial** (Recommended)
**Rationale**: Industry standard, enough time to analyze 2-3 decks thoroughly

### **Trial Abuse Prevention**
1. **Email Verification Required**: Must verify email to start trial
2. **Device Fingerprinting**: Track browser/device characteristics
3. **IP Address Monitoring**: Limit trials per IP (with reasonable exceptions for shared networks)
4. **Credit Card Verification**: Optional - require card but don't charge until trial ends
5. **Phone Verification**: SMS verification for suspicious patterns

### **Trial Experience Design**
- **Full Premium Access**: Don't limit features during trial
- **3 AI Analysis Credits**: Limit usage but allow full experience
- **Progress Tracking**: Show "2 days left" reminders
- **Upgrade Prompts**: Gentle reminders, not aggressive
- **Data Retention**: Keep decks after trial expires, just limit new AI analysis

### **Post-Trial Experience**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Users keep their data, just lose premium features
